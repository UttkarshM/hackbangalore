Installation

There are two ways to install the required dependencies for this project:

Using pip:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project (where the requirements.txt file is located).

Run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

Using a virtual environment (recommended):

Create a virtual environment using tools like venv or virtualenv. Refer to their documentation for specific commands.
Activate the virtual environment (activation commands vary depending on the tool used).
Follow steps 1.b and 1.c from the pip method above to install dependencies within the virtual environment.
Using a virtual environment is recommended as it isolates project dependencies from your system-wide Python packages, preventing conflicts and ensuring a clean development environment.

Additional Notes

If you encounter any issues during installation, refer to the documentation for pip or the specific packages listed in requirements.txt.
You might need administrator privileges to install packages using pip depending on your system configuration.
This template provides clear instructions for both methods, along with explanations about virtual environments and potential issues. Feel free to customize it further with project-specific details or links to relevant documentation.
